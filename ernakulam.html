    <p>The church has a 14-century history. Its perennial well attracted many people, and the church became a pilgrimage site.

        According to historians, Thomas the Apostle (Mar Thoma Sleeha in Malayalam/Syriac) built seven churches. The Edapally church was built during the sixth century, shortly after the construction of the seven churches.
        
        A statue of St. George (Mar Geevarghese Sahada) on horseback, stabbing a serpent under his horse's hooves, is prominent. The church blends religion, magic, myth, folklore and history.[3] Edappally was a hamlet, part of the princely kingdom of Elangalloor.[6] Its Syrian Christian congregation was small,[3] descendants of those who were converted to Christianity by St. Thomas the Apostle (who came to India in 52 AD). The oldest Edappally church was built in 593, and the one-room building is preserved as a storehouse. It was built by families from Paravur who had to travel to the Kottakkavu Mar Thoma Syro-Malabar Church, North Paravur to worship.
        
        The congregation outgrew the old church, and a second church was built in 1080.[2][7] Its main Madaba/altar and fa√ßade were renovated during the 1970s, and a picture of the Virgin Mary was added.[7] The imported-tile floor remains.
        
        The 1400th anniversary of the church's founding was celebrated on 18 January 1994. Mother Teresa visited from Calcutta as the chief guest.[8] To commemorate the occasion, a bell tower was constructed on the church premises and a bell installed. The bell was later moved to the archangel tower of the new church.
        
        The foundation stone for the third church, blessed by Pope John Paul II,[9] was laid on 1 January 2001.[10] The octagonal, 141-foot-high (43 m) church covers a 88,000-square-foot (8,200 m2) area, and is one of India's largest churches.[10] Blending European and Keralite architecture, its madbaha/altar is made of teak covered with gold foil imported from Italy and it has two bell towers.[11][12] Old (original sin, Noah's Ark and Cain and Abel) and New Testament scenes (the story of Jesus) are depicted as sculptures. The altar, depicting the Resurrection, is surrounded by carvings in Vietnamese marble. The 19,500-square-foot (1,810 m2) main chapel has a capacity of 5,000, and the entire church can hold 10,000 people.[10] The two older churches have been preserved for their historic importance.[13]
        
        Vastushilpalaya and Prasanth P George were the new church's architects.[10] The church courtyard has a well, and devotees believe that its water has curative powers. </p>
